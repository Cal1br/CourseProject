        <p>The Dark Age is the first and typical starting Age in Age of Empires II.
            Usual activity for this age consists of exploring and collecting resources for the next age.
            However there are some players that may choose to rush their opponent when they haven't built
            defences yet.

        <p>The Feudal Age is a period of economic development, where military clashes usually begin to occur, such as
            raiding enemy Villagers. It is at this stage of the game when most players decide which strategy they will
            follow in later Ages. Usually the initial food resources are exhausted and farms begin to appear</p>
