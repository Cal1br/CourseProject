            Age of Empires II: The Age of Kings is a real-time strategy computer game set in the Middle Ages. It was
            released in 1999, and is the second main title of the Age of Empires series developed by Ensemble Studios
            and
            published by Microsoft.
        </p>
        <p>The player has control over a society and guides them through four different time periods or <a
                href="gameplayelements/ages.html">"ages"</a>. The game
            begins in the Dark Age, where very few buildings and units are available. After a short time when
            requirements
            are met, the user gains the ability to advance their civilization beginning with the Feudal Age, where more
            upgrades, buildings, and units become available. The next age is the Castle Age, in which the powerful
            Castle
            may be built, and used to produce powerful units including the unique unit of each civilization. Finally,
            the
            user can reach the Imperial Age, which is reminiscent of the early years of the Renaissance. Once the user
            has
            reached the Imperial Age, they gain access to all the upgrades, units, and buildings that may be built and
            researched for their specific civilization.</p>

            and many more...</p>
        <p> Reception of The Age of Kings was highly positive. The significant number of new features was
            praised, as were the gameplay improvements. The Age of Kings received "universal acclaim", according to
            video game review aggregator Metacritic. The game was a complete hit. Most of us can probably recall the
            time when we played it when we were little. Even now, even after 20 years the game remains alive with an
            active and dedicated community.

        <p class="lead othergiants">Place yourself amongst the greatest leaders in history</p>
        <p>The game features an extensive campaign mode in which you can play as a medieval ruler eg: <a
                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attila">Attila
            the Hun</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alaric_I">Alaric</a>, <a

                href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moctezuma_II">Montezuma</a> and many more. There are many cities to
            burn and villages to be razed.

        <p class="lead othergiants">Climb the ladder of competitive play and prove your worth</p>
        <p> The game still has an active and mature community. Almost everyone has or is playing competitively trying to be
            the best in the world. An ELO system calculates how good any given player is. But beware because the climb is
            hard and only the very dedicated will succeed.</p>
